# 42 SO_LONG 2D GAME

## Overview
This is a very simple 2D game that introduced me to the mlx graphics library. This project taught me how to parse mapping files and transfer that layout into png images and how to manipulate the positions of those pixels to create what appears to be movement on the screen. 

## Installation
Simply git clone and run "make". Once the program is made execute the so_long program with a map.ber file from the maps folder.

For example:
```./so_long maps/map.ber```


## Playing The Game
You can move with the A W S D keys. The object of the game is to collect all the potions and then go to the exit of the map.
